## Key Features of Zymmr Burndown Charts

### Choice of Metrics
You can configure the chart to display progress based on your team's preferred estimation method:
-   **Story Points**: Ideal for teams using story points to estimate work.
-   **Effort**: Suitable for teams tracking progress in hours or days.

### The Three Key Lines
The chart displays three lines that together provide a complete picture of your team's progress.

| Line               | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Guideline**      | A straight reference line showing the ideal rate at which work should be completed to finish on time.       |
| **Work Remaining** | Shows the actual amount of work left to be completed. This line should trend downwards towards zero.        |
| **Extrapolation**  | A projected trend line based on the team's current velocity. This helps forecast if the team is on track. (Can be toggled on/off) |

## How to Access and Use Burndown Charts

### Accessing the Chart
1.  Navigate to the **Projects** tab from the main menu.
2.  Select the specific project you want to track.
3.  In the project's left-hand menu, click on the **Burndown Chart** option.

### Configuring and Interpreting the Chart
1.  **Configure Metric**: At the top of the chart, choose whether to display the data in **Story Points** or **Effort**.
2.  **Toggle Extrapolation**: You can turn the **Extrapolation Line** on or off based on your preference for forecasting.
3.  **Analyze the Lines**:
    -   Compare the **Work Remaining** line to the **Guideline**. If your team's remaining work is consistently above the guideline, it may indicate a risk of not completing the work on time.
    -   Use the **Extrapolation Line** to predict a potential completion date based on the team's current pace.

## Benefits of Using Burndown Charts

-   **Transparency**: Provides immediate, clear visibility into how much work is left and the pace at which it's being completed.
-   **Forecasting**: Helps predict if the sprint or project goals will be met on time by comparing actual progress to the ideal guideline.
-   **Problem Identification**: A flat or upward-trending "Work Remaining" line can quickly signal problems, such as scope creep or unforeseen blockers.
-   **Motivation**: A steady downward trend can be highly motivating for the team, showing tangible progress toward their goal.
