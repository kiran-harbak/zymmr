# Burnup Charts

::: info Overview
Zymmr's burnup chart is a powerful visual tool that helps Agile teams track completed work against the total project scope over time. It is particularly useful for visualizing progress, managing scope changes effectively, and forecasting project completion.

## Key Features of Zymmr Burnup Charts

### Choice of Metrics
You can configure the chart to display progress based on your team's preferred estimation method:
-   **Story Points**: Ideal for teams using story points to estimate work.

### The Three Key Lines
The chart's power comes from its three distinct lines, which tell a complete story of your project's progress.

| Line          | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope Line**  | Represents the total amount of work planned for the project or sprint. An upward trend indicates scope creep or added work. |
| **Guideline**   | A straight reference line showing the ideal pace of completion required to meet the project's deadline.         |
| **Work Done**   | Shows the cumulative amount of work completed over time. This line should rise steadily toward the scope line. |

## How to Access and Use Burnup Charts

### Accessing the Chart
1.  Navigate to the **Projects** tab from navbar.
2.  Select the specific project you want to track, clicking on its title.
3.  In the project's left-hand menu, click on the **Burnup Chart** option.

### Configuring and Interpreting the Chart
1.  **Configure Metric**: At the top of the chart, choose the sprint.
2.  **Analyze the Lines**:
    -   Monitor the **Scope Line** for any unexpected increases, which signal that new work has been added.
    -   Compare the **Work Done** line to the **Guideline**. If your team's progress is consistently below the guideline, the project may be at risk of delay.

## Benefits of Using Burnup Charts

-   **Transparency**: Provides clear visibility into how much work has been done versus how much remains.
-   **Forecasting**: Helps predict if the project will be completed on time by comparing the work-done trend to the overall scope.
-   **Scope Management**: Makes it easy to identify when and how much scope has been added, and to discuss its impact on the project timeline.
-   **Motivation**: Visually demonstrating progress can be a powerful motivator for the team, showing tangible results of their hard work.
