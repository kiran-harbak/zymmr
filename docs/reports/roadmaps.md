# Roadmaps 

::: info Overview
Roadmaps in Zymmr provide a high-level, structured view of your project timelines and tasks. Presented in a familiar table format, they function much like a Gantt chart, allowing for clear visualization and management of project milestones and activities over time.

## Key Features

### Table Format
Work items are displayed in a detailed table, giving you an organized overview of your project's components.

The primary columns include:

| Column       | Description                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title**    | The name of the work item, epic, or task.         |
| **Status**   | The current workflow status (e.g., To Do, Done).  |
| **Progress (%)** | A visual percentage bar showing completion.   |
| **Start Date** | The planned or actual start date of the task.     |
| **End Date**   | The planned or actual completion date.            |
| **Tags**     | Custom labels for filtering and categorization.   |

### Gantt-like Order
Tasks are ordered chronologically based on their start and end dates, similar to a traditional Gantt chart. This sequential arrangement helps you understand task dependencies and overall project progression.

### Powerful Filters
You can apply filters to customize the roadmap view based on various criteria, such as task status, tags, or assigned team members. This flexibility allows you to focus on specific aspects of the project or review individual responsibilities.

## Using Roadmaps

### Navigating the Table
Scroll horizontally to view different timeframes and vertically to see all your project tasks. You can adjust the zoom level to get a high-level overview or focus on a specific period.

### Collaboration
Roadmaps serve as a centralized plan that facilitates team collaboration. From the roadmap, team members can click into tasks to:
- Add comments to discuss progress
- Attach relevant files
- Mention other users to ask questions

### Export and Integration
You can export roadmap views to share with stakeholders or integrate with other reporting tools, ensuring everyone stays aligned with the project plan.

::: tip Empower Your Planning
Zymmr's roadmap feature combines the visual clarity of a Gantt chart with the detailed organization of a table. It empowers your team to plan effectively, track progress transparently, and adapt to changing project needs with confidence.
