# Configure Columns in Zymmr

::: info Overview
The **Configure Columns** feature in the "Search across work items" screen allows you to customize which columns are displayed in your search results. Represented by a three-vertical-lines icon, this feature provides flexibility to tailor the view to your specific needs.

## Steps to Configure Columns

### 1. Access Configure Columns
1.  Navigate to the **Search across work items** screen.
2.  Click on the **Configure Columns** icon (three vertical lines) to open the configuration menu.

### 2. Choose Your Columns
A list of all available fields from the work item table will be displayed.
-   Select the fields you want to add to your view by checking the corresponding checkboxes.
-   Uncheck fields you wish to hide.

### 3. Understand Default Columns
There is an option to view or reset to the default column set, which typically includes:
-   Type
-   Title
-   Start Date
-   End Date
-   Primary Assignee
-   Status

### 4. Select Your Configuration Mode
You can save your column configuration in one of two modes:

#### My Defaults
Choose this mode to save a set of columns as your personal default view. These selections will be saved and applied only for your user account whenever you visit the search screen.

#### System Mode
Select this mode to configure the default columns for **all users** across the system.


## Example Use Case

### Scenario
You want to customize your personal search view to include the `Priority` and `Estimated Effort` fields, which are not visible by default.

### Steps
1.  **Access Configure Columns**: In the search screen, click the three-vertical-lines icon.
2.  **Choose Columns**: Scroll through the list and check the boxes for `Priority` and `Estimated Effort`.
3.  **Select Mode**: Ensure you are in **My Defaults** mode to save this view only for yourself.
4.  **Save Configuration**: Close the menu. Your chosen columns will now be displayed in the search results table.

::: tip Tailor Your View
By using the Configure Columns feature, you can tailor the display of work items to fit your specific needs, hiding irrelevant information and highlighting what matters most to you. This significantly enhances your project management efficiency in Zymmr.
