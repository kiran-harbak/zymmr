# Changing a Work Item's Sprint

::: info Overview
As project priorities evolve, you may need to move a work item from one sprint to another. Zymmr provides several flexible methods to change a work item's associated sprint, ensuring your sprint plan always reflects the team's current focus. This feature is for scrum project work items. 
:::

## Method 1: Drag and Drop

This is the quickest and most visual method, ideal for when you are viewing the project backlog.

1.  Navigate to the **Project Backlog** view where you can see both your active and future sprints.
2.  Simply **drag** the work item card from its current sprint.
3.  **Drop** the card into the desired sprint section (either a future sprint or back into the backlog).

## Method 2: Using the Work Item Details

This method is useful when you are already viewing or editing a specific work item.

1.  Open the detailed view of the work item you want to move.
2.  Locate the **Sprint** section in the tabs present below Milestones.
3.  Click on the dropdown menu and select the desired sprint from the list. The change is saved automatically.

::: info Sprint History
In the Sprint section of the work item details, you can also view a complete **history** of all the sprints this item has been a part of, providing full traceability.
:::

## Method 3: Using the Options Menu

You can also change the sprint from the work item's "more options" menu.

1.  From the detailed work item view, click the **three dots icon (`...`)** in the top right corner to open the options menu.
2.  Select the **Change Sprint** option from the dropdown.
3.  A new dropdown will appear, allowing you to choose the target sprint.

## Example Use Case

### Scenario
A task in the current sprint has been de-prioritized and needs to be moved to the next planned sprint to make room for more urgent work.

### Steps
You can accomplish this using any of the three methods:
-   **Drag and Drop**: From the backlog view, drag the task card from the "Active Sprint" section and drop it into the "Next Sprint" section.
-   **Work Item Details**: Open the task, click the sprint dropdown, and select "Next Sprint".
-   **Options Menu**: Open the task, click the `...` menu, select "Change Sprint," and choose "Next Sprint".

::: tip Keep Your Sprint Accurate
Regularly moving items between sprints ensures your active sprint accurately reflects the team's commitment and helps maintain a clean, prioritized backlog for future planning.
