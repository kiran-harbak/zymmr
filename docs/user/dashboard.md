# Your Dashboard

::: info Overview
The Dashboard is your personal command center in Zymmr. It provides an immediate, high-level overview of your workload, time estimate, and personal performance. Designed for interactivity, it allows you to drill down into specific lists and navigate quickly to the work that needs your attention.

## 1. Summary Metrics

At the top of the dashboard, three key metric cards provide a snapshot of your current workload.

| Card | Description | Interaction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Completed Work Items** | Shows the number of work items you have finished in the **Last 30 Days**. | **Click the number** to navigate to the Search page, automatically filtered to show these completed items. |
| **In Progress Work Items** | Displays the total count of work items currently assigned to you that are in progress. | **Click the number** to view the full list of your active tasks on the Search page. |
| **Due Work Items** | Indicates how many work items assigned to you are currently due or overdue. | **Click the number** to jump to the Search page and triage these urgent items. |

## 2. Performance and Time Tracking

These visual charts help you understand your productivity trends and capacity.

-   **Performance Chart**: A line graph tracking the volume of work items you have completed over recent months. This helps identify trends in your delivery speed.
-   **Time Gauge**: A bar chart providing a comparison of your **Estimated** effort versus your **Logged** time and **Remaining** time for the immediate future (e.g., the current week). This is excellent for self-managing capacity.

## 3. Projects Overview

The **Projects** section lists the projects you are actively involved in.

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **KEY** | The unique identifier for the project (e.g., `BTB`). |
| **NAME** | The full name of the project. |
| **TYPE** | The methodology used (e.g., `Scrum`, `Kanban`). |
| **START/END DATE** | The planned timeline for the project. |

::: tip Quick Navigation
Clicking on a project's **KEY** (e.g., `BTB`) will take you directly to that project's **Backlog** page, allowing you to jump straight into planning.

## 4. Work Item Lists

The bottom half of the dashboard is dedicated to specific lists of tasks requiring your attention.

### Overdue Work Items
This list highlights items that have passed their due date.
-   **Details**: Shows the Key, Type, Status, and a red tag indicating how many days the item is overdue.
-   **Navigation**: Click the **Show All** link to open a filtered search view of all your overdue items.

### In Progress Work Items
This list displays the work you are currently tackling.
-   **Details**: Includes the Title, Priority, Dates, and Time tracking details (Logged vs. Remaining).
-   **Navigation**: Click the **Show All** link to manage your active workload on the search page.

::: info Opening Work Items
Throughout the dashboard (in both Overdue and In Progress lists), clicking on a **Work Item Key** (e.g., `BA-2627`) will open the work item's **Side View**. This allows you to edit details, log time, or add comments without leaving the dashboard.
