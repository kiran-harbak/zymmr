# Project Attributes

::: info Overview
Project Attributes are custom labels or metadata that you can assign to your projects to categorize and organize them. Think of them as high-level tags that describe key characteristics of a project, such as its technology platform, business domain, or application type. 
:::

## 1. How to Access a Project's Attributes

Attributes are configured within a specific project's detailed settings.

1.  Begin on the main **Projects** listing page where all your projects are displayed.
2.  Locate your target project in the list.
3.  Click on the external link icon <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2.0" stroke="currentColor" class="navigation-icon"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M13.5 6H5.25A2.25 2.25 0 003 8.25v10.5A2.25 2.25 0 005.25 21h10.5A2.25 2.25 0 0018 18.75V10.5m-10.5 6L21 3m0 0h-5.25M21 3v5.25"></path></svg> located next to the project name to open its detailed settings.
4.  In the left-hand navigation menu of the settings page, click on **Attributes**.

You will now be on the Project Attributes screen, ready to configure your project's classifications.

## 2. How to Set or Change Project Attributes

The Attributes screen presents a simple form where you can assign values to the predefined categories for your organization.

### Understanding the Fields
-   **Attribute Fields** (e.g., `Platform`, `Domain`, `Application type`): These are the categories you can use to classify your project. Each field is a dropdown list containing predefined options, ensuring consistent categorization across all projects.
-   **Save Button**: This button confirms and applies your selections to the project.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Attributes
1.  Click on the dropdown field for the attribute you want to set (e.g., click on the "Platform" field).
2.  A list of available options will appear. Select the value that best describes your project.
3.  Repeat this process for any other attributes you wish to configure.
4.  Once you have made all your desired selections, click the **Save** button located at the bottom right of the screen to apply your changes.

::: tip The Power of Consistency
Using a predefined set of attributes ensures that everyone categorizes projects in the same way. This consistency is what makes cross-project filtering and reporting so powerful and reliable in Zymmr.

::: warning Admin-Configured
The available attributes and their dropdown options (e.g., "Platform," "Domain") are configured by a system administrator in the global settings. If you need a new attribute or option added, please contact your Zymmr administrator.
