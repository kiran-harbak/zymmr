### Project Statuses

Project statuses help track the current state of projects. Common statuses include:

| Status    | Description                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Active    | Project is currently in progress                     |
| On Hold   | Project temporarily paused                           |
| Completed | Project finished                                     |
| Archived  | Project no longer active but preserved for reference |

::: tip Customization
Project statuses can be customized at the organization level to match your workflow needs. Contact your administrator to configure custom statuses.

### Project Categories

Projects are organized using predefined categories like:

- **Support**: For customer support and maintenance projects
- **Product**: For product development projects

Categories can be customized at the organization level to meet your needs. Common use cases include:

- Organizing related projects into logical groups
- Filtering and searching project listings efficiently
- Generating reports based on project categories
- Managing shared resource pools across projects

Some examples of custom categories:

| Category         | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Shared Resources | Projects focused on resource management       |
| DevOps           | Infrastructure, deployment and CI/CD projects |
| Research         | Innovation and R&D initiatives                |
| Client Projects  | External client deliverables                  |
| Internal         | Internal tooling and process improvements     |

::: info Note
While Support and Product are default categories, administrators can add more categories at the organization level to better organize projects.
