## 3. How to Action Leave Requests

Your primary task on this screen is to respond to requests that are in the `AWAITING` or `PENDING` state.

1.  **Locate the Request**: Find the leave request you need to review in the list.
2.  **Review the Details**: Check the employee's name, the requested leave date, the type of leave, and the reason provided.
3.  **Choose Your Action**: In the "ACTION" column for that request, you will have two primary options:
    -   **Approve**: Click this link to grant the leave request and confirm your action. The status will change to `APPROVED`, and the system will now consider this day a non-working day for that employee, updating resource planning information accordingly. You will still have the ability to **reject** the request after its already approved.
    -   **Reject**: Click this link to deny the leave request and confirm your action. The status will change to `REJECTED`, and the employee will be notified. Their working capacity for that day will remain unchanged. Once rejected you cannot approve the request.

::: tip Timeliness is Key
It is important to action leave requests promptly so your team members can plan accordingly and so that project resource plans remain up-to-date.
