# Your Zymmr Leave Calendar

::: info Overview
The Leave Calendar, found within your personal profile, is your central hub for managing your time off. Here, you can submit new leave requests, view the status of past and present requests, and see a history of your applications. Any approved leave marks your selected days as non-working days, which is critical information used for accurate resource and capacity planning.

## 1. The Leave Calendar Dashboard

This screen provides a comprehensive history of all your leave applications.

-   **+ Apply for Leave Button**: Located in the top right, this is used to submit a new request for time off.

| **LEAVE TYPE**      | The category of leave you requested (e.g., `Sick Leave`, `Casual Leave`), as defined by your administrator.   |
| **REASON**          | The reason you provided for the leave.                                                                        |
| **STATUS**          | The current state of your request: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, or `CANCELLED`.                         |
| **APPROVER**        | The user who reviewed (or will review) your request.                                                          |
| **ACTION**          | Allows you to take action on a request, such as **Cancel**.                                                   |

## 2. How to Apply for Leave

1.  From the Leave Calendar dashboard, click the **+ Apply for Leave** button.
2.  The "New Leave Application" modal will appear.
3.  Fill in the required information:

| Field               | Description                                                                                          |
| :----------------   | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application Date**| This is automatically set to the current date and time.                                              |
| **Type** `*`        | Select the category of leave you are requesting from the dropdown menu.                              |

| **Approver** `*`    | Select your manager or the designated approver for your leave.                                       |

Once all fields are complete, click the **Apply** button. Your request will now appear in your Leave Calendar list with a `PENDING` status.

## 3. Understanding Date Validation

Zymmr's leave system includes rules to ensure that requests adhere to company policy. The most common rule is the minimum notice period. Each **Leave Type** can have an "Apply Before (Days)" rule configured by your administrator.

::: warning Example: Validation Error
If you see a validation error message like `"Leave date must be at least 2 days from today"`:

This means the **Leave Type** you have selected requires you to apply for it at least 2 days before the leave date. You will not be able to select a date that violates this rule. If you need to request leave with shorter notice, you may need to select a different leave type (if available) or contact your approver directly.

## 4. Managing Your Submitted Requests

After you have submitted a leave request, you can still manage it from the Leave Calendar dashboard.

### Cancelling a Request
If you no longer need to take a day off, you can withdraw your request.
1.  Find the leave request in the list.
2.  Click the **Cancel** link in the "ACTION" column.
3.  Confirm the cancellation when prompted.

The status of the request will change to `CANCELLED`. You can typically cancel requests that are in either a `PENDING` or `APPROVED` state.
