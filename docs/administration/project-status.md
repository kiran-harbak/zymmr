# Project Status

::: info Overview
The Project Status feature, located in **Global Settings** ⚙️, allows you to create a standardized list of high-level statuses that can be assigned to your projects. Unlike the statuses in a workflow (like `To Do`, `In Progress`), which track individual work items, a Project Status describes the overall health of an entire project (e.g., `On Track`, `At Risk`, `On Hold`, `Completed`). This provides a quick, at-a-glance understanding of your project portfolio.
:::

## 1. The Project Status Dashboard

The main Project Status screen is your central repository for all possible statuses a project can have. From this dashboard, you can:

-   View all available statuses in a paginated list.
-   Use the **Search Bar** at the top to quickly find a specific status.
-   Create a new status using the **+ Add Status** button.
-   Manage existing statuses using the action icons in each row.

## 2. How to Create a New Project Status

1.  From the Project Status dashboard, click the **+ Add Status** button in the top-right corner.
2.  The "Add Project Status" modal window will appear.
3.  In the **Status** field, enter the name for your new status (e.g., "Needs Review," "Blocked," "Cancelled"). This field is required.
4.  Click the **Add** button to save the new status.

It will now appear in the list on the main dashboard and become available for selection within your projects.

## 3. How to Manage Existing Statuses

You can easily edit or delete statuses from the list using the action icons.

### Editing a Project Status
1.  Find the status you wish to change in the list.
2.  Click the **Edit** (pencil) icon in its row.
3.  The "Edit Project Status" modal will appear, pre-filled with the current name.
4.  Make your changes to the name and click **Save**.

### Deleting a Project Status
1.  Find the status you wish to delete.
2.  Click the **Delete** (trash can) icon in its row.
3.  A confirmation prompt will appear to prevent accidental deletion. Confirm the action to remove the status.

::: tip Where to Use Project Status
A project's status is typically set on its main configuration or details page. It serves as a key indicator on high-level dashboards and reports, like the **Project Insights Dashboard**.

::: warning Before You Delete
It is best practice to check if any active projects are currently assigned a status before you delete it. Removing a status that is in use might require you to update those projects with a new, appropriate status first to avoid data inconsistencies.
