# Look & Feel

::: info Overview
The Look & Feel feature, located in **Global Settings** ⚙️, allows you to personalize your Zymmr instance by applying your own company branding. The primary function of this page is to upload your company's logo, which will be displayed on the main login screen to provide a consistent and branded experience for all your users.
:::

## 1. How to Access the Look & Feel Screen

To customize your Zymmr instance's logo:
1.  Navigate to the main **Global Settings** area using the left-hand sidebar menu.
2.  Locate and click on **Look & Feel** in the sidebar.

You will now be on the Look & Feel customization page.

## 2. The Look & Feel Interface

The interface for customizing your logo is simple and direct.

-   **Logo Preview**: This area at the top of the screen shows a preview of the currently active logo. By default, it will display the Zymmr logo.
-   **Upload Area**: This is the interactive element for changing the logo, clearly marked with an upload icon. It also specifies the technical requirements for the image file:
    -   **Supported File Formats**: `SVG`, `PNG`, or `JPG`
    -   **Maximum File Size**: 10MB

## 3. How to Change Your Logo

Follow these simple steps to replace the default Zymmr logo with your own.

1.  **Prepare Your Logo File**: Before you begin, ensure your logo file is saved in one of the supported formats (`SVG`, `PNG`, or `JPG`) and does not exceed the 10MB size limit.
2.  **Click to Upload**: Click anywhere inside the large upload area. This will open your computer's standard file browser.
3.  **Select Your Logo**: Navigate to the location of your logo file on your computer, select it, and click "Open" or "Select."
4.  **Verification**: The **Logo Preview** area should immediately update to display your new logo. The change is typically saved automatically upon a successful upload.

Your Zymmr instance is now customized! The next time any user visits the **login page**, they will see your company's logo.

## 4. How to Reset Your Logo to Default
If you have uploaded a custom logo and wish to return to the standard Zymmr logo:
1.  Locate the **Reset to Default** text that appears next to the logo preview.
2.  Click the text.
3.  The **Logo Preview** will immediately update to show the default Zymmr logo, and the change will be saved automatically.


::: tip Best Practices for Your Logo
-   **Image Quality**: For the best visual result on the login screen, use a high-resolution logo.
-   **Transparent Background**: A logo with a transparent background (saved as a `PNG` or `SVG`) is often ideal as it will adapt best to the login page's design.
