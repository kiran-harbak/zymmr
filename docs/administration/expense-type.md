# Expense Types

::: info Overview
The Expense Types feature, located in **Global Settings** ⚙️, allows administrators to define the standard categories used for tracking project costs. These types populate the dropdown options when users add expenses in the **Project Costing** module.
:::

## 1. The Expense Types Dashboard

This screen serves as the central registry for all expense categories available in your system.

-   **Search Bar**: Quickly find a specific expense type by name.
-   **+ Add Expense Type Button**: The primary action to create a new category.

The dashboard table displays the following:

| Column           | Description                                                        |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EXPENSE TYPE** | The name of the category (e.g., `Rent`, `Equipment`).              |
| **ACTIONS**      | Icons to **Edit** (pencil) or **Delete** (trash can) the type.     |

## 2. How to Create a New Expense Type

1.  From the dashboard, click the **+ Add Expense Type** button.
2.  The "Add Expense Type" modal window will appear.
3.  Enter a clear, descriptive name in the **Expense Type** field (e.g., "Hosting Fees").
4.  Click **Add** to save the new category.

It will now be available for selection whenever a user adds an expense to a project.

## 3. Managing Expense Types

You can maintain your list of categories using the action icons.

-   **Editing**: Click the **Edit** (pencil) icon to rename an expense type. This is useful for correcting typos or updating terminology.
-   **Deleting**: Click the **Delete** (trash can) icon to remove a category that is no longer needed.
