# Work Item

::: info Overview
In Zymmr, we refer to tasks as "work items." This is more than just a name; it's a dynamic system designed to distinguish and categorize different types of work. Whether you're fixing bugs or managing large-scale initiatives, our diverse work item types ensure you have the right tool for every job.
:::

## Default Work Item Types

Each Zymmr project comes with a set of default work item types designed to meet the needs of most teams.

### Epic
An **Epic** represents a large body of work that is too complex to be completed in a single sprint. It serves as a container for smaller, related `Stories`, `Tasks`, and `Bugs`, providing a high-level view of progress on a major feature or initiative.

### Bug
A **Bug** is a problem or defect that impairs or prevents a product from functioning correctly. Bugs are typically prioritized and addressed to ensure product quality.

### Story
A **User Story** (or Story) is the smallest unit of work in an Agile framework, expressed from the end-user's perspective. It describes a piece of functionality that provides value to the user.

### Task
A **Task** represents a specific, actionable job that needs to be completed by the team. Unlike a Story, a Task doesn't necessarily deliver direct value to the end-user but is required for the project's progress (e.g., "Set up a new test environment").

### Subtask
A **Subtask** is a smaller piece of work required to complete a parent work item. Any standard work item type (like a Bug, Story, or Task) can be broken down into one or more Subtasks.

::: tip Tailor to Your Process
We understand that one size doesn't fit all. That's why Zymmr allows administrators to create custom work item types and configure schemes to align seamlessly with your team's specific project management process.

::: warning Administrative Permissions
To create, edit, or delete the work item *types* available in Zymmr, you must have **Global Admin** or **Account Admin** permissions. Regular users can create and manage individual work items within a project.
