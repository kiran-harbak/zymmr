### WorkItem Workflow

A workflow in Zymmr is like a recipe that guides you through the steps to get work done. WorkItems follow a defined workflow that is managed through states and transitions (actions).

#### Basic Workflow States

At minimum, a WorkItem goes through 3-4 basic states:

- New
- In Progress
- Done
- On Hold (optional)

::: tip Finding Available States
In Zymmr, workflow states are managed through the 'Status' field. This field shows you the next available states your WorkItem can transition to.
:::

The workflow ensures that:

- Work follows a consistent process
- Teams can track progress effectively
- Status changes are properly documented
- Work moves through appropriate stages

::: info Status Transitions
Status changes follow a predefined path ensuring proper workflow management and tracking. Your admin can customize these workflows to match your team's process.
