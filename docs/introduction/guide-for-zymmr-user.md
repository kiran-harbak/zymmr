# Getting Started Guide for Zymmr Users

::: info Welcome to Zymmr!
This guide is designed to get you up and running as a Zymmr end-user. We'll walk you through the key concepts and daily actions you'll perform, from finding your projects to updating your work.
:::

## Who is this Guide For?

A Zymmr user can be anyone from Development, Operations, or Marketing teams. This guide is specifically designed for team members who will be actively working on projects. Your daily tasks will likely include:

-   Working on **WorkItems** as a Primary or Secondary Assignee
-   Updating the **Status** of your tasks
-   Adding **Comments** to collaborate with your team
-   **Logging time** on your work

::: warning Prerequisites
To get started, your admin will need to set up a project for you and your team to work in.
:::

## Understanding Zymmr Projects

A **Project** in Zymmr is a container that groups related **WorkItems** together. This could cover anything from a single day's work to a complex initiative that will take your team months to complete.

### How to Access Your Projects
1.  After logging in, you will typically land on the main **Projects** page.
2.  You can also access this page at any time by clicking the **Projects** tab in the top navigation bar.
3.  Use the search function to quickly find a specific project.
4.  Click on your desired project's name to navigate to its main page, which is usually the **Project Backlog**.

## Working with WorkItems

A **WorkItem** is the fundamental unit of work in Zymmr. It can represent a `Task`, a `Bug`, a `User Story`, or any other piece of work that needs to be tracked.

### Accessing WorkItems
You can find and access your assigned work in several places:
-   The **Project Backlog** list (available in both Kanban and Scrum projects).
-   The **Active Sprint Board** (for Scrum projects).
-   The **Global Search** bar in the top navigation header.


::: tip Auto-Save Feature
Updating fields is fast and easy. Simply click on a field (like **Status** or **Assignee**), make your change, and click away. Your changes are **automatically saved** without requiring you to click a "Save" button.
:::

### Adding Comments
Comments are how you keep your team informed about your progress.
-   **Mentioning Team Members**: To notify a specific person, type `@` in your comment, begin typing their name, and select them from the dropdown list. They will receive a notification about your comment.

### Logging Your Work
1.  Open the work item.
2.  Click the Time Log tab below milestones.
3.  Click add button.
4.  Fill in the required information: `Work Type`, `Date`, `Time Spent`, `Billable` and a `Description`.
5.  Click **Add** to save your time log.

## Understanding Your Workflow

A **Workflow** in Zymmr is like a recipe that guides a task from start to finish. It is defined by a series of statuses and the actions that move a task between them.

### Basic Workflow States
At a minimum, a WorkItem typically moves through these basic states:

| State         | Description                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------------ |
| **New**       | The task has been created.      |
| **In Progress**| You are actively working on it. |
| **Done**        | The work is complete.           |

### How to Change a WorkItem's Status
In Zymmr, you manage a WorkItem's workflow through the **Status** field.
-   When you click the **Status** field on a WorkItem, it will show you a dropdown of only the available next steps in the workflow.
-   This ensures that work follows a consistent process and progress is tracked effectively.

::: info Workflows are Customizable
Your Zymmr administrator can customize workflows to perfectly match your team's process, so the statuses you see may be different from the basic examples above.
