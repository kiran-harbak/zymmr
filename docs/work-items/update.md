# Updating a Work Item

::: info Overview
Zymmr uses a dynamic, inline editing model that allows you to update work item details quickly and efficiently. Instead of a separate "edit" mode, you can modify most fields directly in the detailed view, with changes saved automatically.
:::

## 1. Finding the Work Item to Update

First, locate the work item you wish to modify. You can find work items in several ways:

-   **Project Boards**: Navigate to a project's **Backlog** or **Active Sprint Board**.
-   **Global Search**: Use the main search bar in the top navigation to search by key or title.
-   **Search Page**: Use the dedicated Filter Functionality on the work items page to build a specific query.

## 2. How to Update Work Item Details

Once you've located the work item, the editing process is seamless.

1.  **Open the Detailed View**: Click on the work item's **Key** (e.g., `ZYM-123`) or its title to open the full details panel or page.
2.  **Click Directly on a Field**: Hover over a field you want to change (like `Status`, `Assignee`, or `Priority`) and click on it.
3.  **Make Your Change**: An input control (e.g., a text box, dropdown menu, or date picker) will appear. Select the new value or type your changes.
4.  **Save Automatically**: Click outside the field or press the `Enter` key. Your change is saved instantly. There is no "Save" button to click.


::: info Activity Log
Rest assured, every change is tracked. The full history of all updates—including who made the change, what was changed, and when—is automatically recorded in the work item's **Activity Log**.

::: tip Permissions Matter
Your ability to edit certain fields may be limited by your project role. If you are unable to modify a field, it is likely due to the project's configured.
