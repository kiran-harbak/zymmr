## How to Plan and Start a Sprint

Follow these steps to move work from your backlog into an active sprint.

### 1. Navigate to the Project Backlog
First, you need to access the backlog for the project you are planning.
1.  Go to the main **Projects** view.
2.  Click on your project's name to open its details page.
3.  Select the **Backlog** tab to view your product backlog.

### 2. Create a New Sprint
The backlog view is where you will create the container for your upcoming sprint.
1.  At the top of the backlog, click the **Create Sprint** button.
2.  A popup will appear. Fill in the sprint details:
    - **Sprint Title**: Give your sprint a descriptive name (e.g., "October Sprint Week 1-2" or "Q4-Sprint-1").
    - **Start Date**: The date the sprint will begin.
    - **End Date**: The date the sprint will conclude.
3.  Click **Save**. A new, empty sprint section will appear above your backlog.

### 3. Add Work Items to the Sprint
With your sprint created, you can now populate it with work items.
- Simply **drag and drop** work items from the backlog list into your newly created sprint section.
- Continue adding items until the team agrees on the sprint's scope.

### 4. Start the Sprint
Once the sprint is planned and filled with work items, you are ready to begin.
1.  Review the work items in the sprint with your team.
2.  Click the **Start Sprint** button to officially begin the sprint.

::: tip Success! Your Sprint is Live!
Once you start the sprint, you will be automatically redirected to the **Active Sprint Board**, where you can track the progress of all the work items you just planned.
