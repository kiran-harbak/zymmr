# Board Settings in Zymmr

::: info Overview
Board Settings provide powerful configuration options to customize your **Active Sprint Board**. By tailoring columns, filters, and swimlanes, you can create a board that perfectly visualizes your team's unique workflow and helps you manage work items more effectively.
:::

## Accessing Board Settings

1.  Navigate to your project's **Backlog page,** **Board, or** **Active Sprint Board**.
2.  In the top right corner of the board, click the settings icon (represented by `...`) to open the **Board Settings** configuration page.

## Configuring Board Settings

The settings page is divided into several sections, allowing you to configure different aspects of your board.

### Board Title
You can set or change the title of your board here. A descriptive title is useful when managing multiple boards.

### Filter Options
Choose which projects or work items are visible on the board. This helps in focusing on specific projects or work items

### Board Columns
This is where you map your project's workflow statuses to the board's vertical columns.

- **Select Columns**: Choose which columns will appear on your board. You can add, remove, or reorder columns to match your team's process.
- **Map Statuses**: For each column, drag and drop the relevant workflow statuses into it. For example, your "In Progress" column might contain the statuses `In Development`, `Code Review`, and `Testing`.

### Swimlanes
Swimlanes are horizontal lanes that group work items across all columns, providing another layer of organization. You can configure swimlanes to group work items based on attributes like:

- **Assigned To**: Creates a separate lane for each team member.
- **Project**: Useful for boards that show items from multiple projects.
- **Priority**: Organizes work into lanes based on priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- **Work Item Type**: Sorts work items into lanes by their type (e.g., Bug, Feature, Task).

## Saving and Applying Settings

1.  After making your desired configurations, click the **Save** button to apply the changes.
2.  Navigate back to your board to review the updates and ensure it reflects your new settings correctly.

::: info Note
