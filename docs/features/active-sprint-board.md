# Active Sprint Board in Zymmr

::: info Overview
The Active Sprint Board is a core visual tool in Zymmr designed to track the progress of work items within a current sprint. It provides a real-time, shared view of all tasks, helping teams manage their workflow, identify bottlenecks, and stay aligned on sprint goals.
:::

## Default Columns on the Board

By default, the Active Sprint Board is organized into columns that represent the typical stages of a workflow.

| Column        | Description                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open**      | Displays newly added work items that have not yet been started.      |
| **Approved**  | Contains work items that have been reviewed and are ready for work.  |
| **In Progress** | Shows work items that a team member is actively working on.         |
| **Done**      | Lists completed work items that are finished for the sprint.         |

## How to Access the Active Sprint Board

1.  Navigate to the **Project Backlog** page for your Scrum project.
2.  In the left-hand navigation menu, click on the **Active Sprint** link to open the board.

## Using the Active Sprint Board

### Viewing Work Items
The board provides an at-a-glance view of all work items in the sprint, organized into their current status columns.

### Managing Work Items
- **Move Work Items**: Simply **drag and drop** work items between columns to update their status as they progress through the workflow.
- **Create New Work Items**: Click the **Create** button to add work items to the Open column.
- **Update Work Item Details**: Click on any work item card to open its detailed view, where you can add comments, log time, or modify fields.

### Tracking Progress
Regularly monitor the flow of work items from left to right across the board. This helps in assessing sprint velocity and quickly identifying any stages where work is piling up.

## Customizing the Active Sprint Board

You can tailor the board to match your team's specific workflow.

### Customizing Columns
The columns on the board are mapped to your project's workflow statuses. You can add, remove, or rename columns from the **Board Settings** page.

- Access this by clicking the settings icon (`...`) on the top right of the board.
- For a complete guide, refer to our Board Settings documentation.

### Customizing Card Content
You can choose what information (e.g., assignee, story points, priority) is displayed on the work item cards.

- Access this by clicking the customization icon (`...`) on the top right of the board and selecting the customize option.
- For more details, refer to our Board Customize documentation.
