# Project Milestones

::: info Overview
In project management, milestones are significant checkpoints that represent key achievements or the completion of a major phase of work. They serve as important markers, allowing teams to track progress, stay focused, and effectively communicate and celebrate accomplishments ðŸŽ‰.

## Examples of Common Project Milestones

Here are some typical milestones you might encounter during a project's lifecycle.

### Project Kickoff
This marks the official start of the project. It typically involves a kickoff meeting to outline project objectives, scope, and roles, setting the stage for all future work.

### Completion of Project Planning
Finalizing the project plan, including tasks, timelines, and resource allocation, is a critical milestone. It ensures the team is aligned and ready to move into the execution phase.

### Prototype Development
For software or product development, completing a functional prototype is a significant achievement. It allows stakeholders to visualize the end product and provide crucial early feedback.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Successfully completing UAT signifies that the project deliverables meet the end-users' requirements and expectations, and the product is ready for deployment.

### Launch or Go-Live
The official launch or deployment of the project is often the most visible milestone. It marks the successful completion of the development phase and the beginning of the product's operational life.

### Client Approval
For projects involving external clients, obtaining formal client approval is a key milestone. It confirms that the project has met the client's satisfaction and is ready for closure.

### Project Review and Lessons Learned
Conducting a post-project review and documenting lessons learned is a final, important milestone. It facilitates continuous improvement for future projects and captures valuable knowledge.
