# Kanban Project Management

::: info Overview
Kanban is a visual workflow management method that emphasizes continuous delivery, efficiency, and full transparency of work. It uses a visual board to represent tasks and their flow through various stages, helping teams optimize their processes and deliver value consistently.
:::

## Key Components of Kanban

The Kanban method is defined by a set of core practices that promote a smooth and efficient workflow.

- **Visual Kanban Board**: The cornerstone of Kanban. In Zymmr, this is a board with columns representing the stages of your workflow (e.g., **To Do**, **In Progress**, **In Review**, **Done**). Each work item is a card on the board.

- **Continuous Delivery**: Focus on delivering small, incremental updates continuously rather than in large, infrequent batches. This reduces risk and delivers value to customers faster.

- **Pull System**: Team members "pull" tasks from a backlog or the previous stage only when they have the capacity to work on them. This prevents overburdening the team and ensures a balanced, sustainable pace.

- **Flexible Planning**: Kanban allows teams to adapt to changing priorities with ease. New high-priority items can be added to the backlog and pulled into the workflow without disrupting the entire system.

- **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)**: Teams regularly review and improve their processes by analyzing flow, gathering feedback, and making incremental changes to enhance efficiency and quality.

- **Metrics and Analytics**: Kanban relies on key metrics to measure performance. Zymmr provides tools to track **cycle time**, **lead time**, and **throughput**, giving insights into process efficiency and identifying areas for improvement.

## Setting up a Kanban Project in Zymmr

Implementing a Kanban system in Zymmr is straightforward. Follow these steps to get started.

1.  **Create Your Kanban Board**
    When you create a new project, select the **Kanban** type. Zymmr will automatically set up a visual Kanban board with default columns representing a standard workflow. You can customize these columns later in **Board Settings**.

2.  **Add Work Items**
    Populate your board's backlog (typically the first column) with tasks. Each task becomes a card that will move across the board as work progresses.

3.  **Prioritize Tasks**
    Continuously review and prioritize the tasks in your backlog column. The most important items should be at the top, ready to be pulled into the workflow.

4.  **Hold Daily Stand-ups**
    Even without sprints, daily stand-ups are valuable for Kanban teams. Use this time to review the board, discuss progress, identify blockers, and coordinate efforts for the day.

5.  **Monitor the Flow**
    The primary goal is to maintain a smooth flow of work. Regularly track the movement of cards across the board and use Zymmrâ€™s built-in metrics to analyze your workflow.

6.  **Review and Adapt**
    Conduct periodic reviews (often called "Kaizen events") to discuss what's working and what isn't. Identify bottlenecks, gather feedback from the team, and implement improvements to your process.

## Utilizing Kanban Metrics in Zymmr

Zymmr helps you track essential Kanban metrics to optimize your workflow:

- **Cycle Time**: Measure the time taken for a task to move from start to completion.
- **Lead Time**: Tracks the total time from when a task is first requested (added to the backlog) to when it is finally delivered. This metric reflects the customer's perspective.
- **Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)**: Visualize the number of tasks in each stage over time to identify bottlenecks and workflow efficiency.
- **Throughput**: Measures the number of tasks completed within a specific time period (e.g., per week). It is a key indicator of your team's productivity and delivery rate.

::: tip Best Practices for Kanban in Zymmr
- **Limit Work In Progress (WIP)**: Set limits on the number of cards allowed in "In Progress" columns. This prevents multitasking and helps identify bottlenecks quickly.
- **Keep the Board Updated**: The board should always be a single source of truth. Ensure team members move their cards in real-time.
- **Make Policies Explicit**: Clearly define what "Done" means for each stage of your workflow to ensure consistency.
