# Board Customization

::: info Overview
Board Customization allows you to personalize your sprint board by choosing which fields are visible on each work item card. This helps you and your team see the most relevant information at a glance, without needing to open each task.
:::

## How to Access Board Customization

1.  Navigate to your project's **Backlog page,** **Board, or** **Active Sprint Board**.
2.  In the top right corner, click the settings icon (represented by `...`).
3.  From the dropdown menu, select **Board Customize**.

## Customizing Card Fields

Once you open the customization panel, you can configure the card layout.



1.  A panel or modal window will appear, listing all available fields.
2.  Use the checkboxes or toggle switches next to each field name to select or deselect it.
3.  Changes are often applied in real-time, or you may need to click a **Save** or **Apply** button.

## Commonly Displayed Fields

Here are some useful fields you might want to display on your cards:

| Field             | Why It's Useful                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assignee**      | Instantly see who is responsible for each task.            |
| **Priority**      | Quickly identify the most critical items on the board.     |
| **Story Points**  | Understand the estimated effort for each work item.        |
| **Due Date**      | Keep track of important deadlines without opening the task. |
| **Tags / Labels** | Visually categorize work items for easy identification.    |

::: tip Board Customize vs. Board Settings
It's important to understand the difference between these two options:

- **Board Customize** (this guide): Changes the **content** and appearance of the individual cards on your board.
- **Board Settings**: Changes the **structure** of the board itself, such as its columns, swimlanes, and filters.

::: warning Note
Board customization settings are often user-specific or board-specific. Changes you make might not affect what other team members see, allowing everyone to create a view that works best for them.
