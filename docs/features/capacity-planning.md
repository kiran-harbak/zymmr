Effective capacity planning is crucial for managing team resources and ensuring project success.

- **Overallocation Highlighting**: The system automatically identifies and visually highlights instances where a team member is allocated more work than their defined capacity, allowing for immediate intervention.

- **Centralized Capacity Visibility**: View the capacity, allocation, and availability for all team members in one comprehensive dashboard, enabling better strategic planning.
